# Actions on Google: Webhook Boilerplate 

This sample demonstrates the base webhook required for building Actions on Google for use on Google Assistant -- using the [Node.js client library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs) and deployed on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/).

## Setup Instructions
Select **only one** of the options below. 

### Option 1: Add to Dialogflow 
Select the button below and follow prompts to create a new agent:

[![Webhook Boilerplate](https://storage.googleapis.com/dialogflow-oneclick/deploy.svg "Webhook Boilerplate")](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/oneclick?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fdialogflow-oneclick%2Fagent.zip&agentName=ActionsOnGoogleTemplateSample)

### Option 2: Dialogflow Console and Firebase CLI
### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and NPM
    + We recommend installing using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using version 6.5.0, `npm install -g firebase-tools@6.5.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Configuration
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), New project (this will become your *Project ID*) > **Create project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**
1. From the top navigation menu under **Develop** > **Actions** (left nav) > **Add your first action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. From the left menu > select **Intents** > **Default Welcome Intent**, scroll down to the end of the page and under **Fulfillment** > **Enable Webhook** > **Save**. 
   + This will allow you to have the welcome intent be a basic webhook intent to test.
 
#### Firebase Deployment 
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.
 
#### Dialogflow Console 
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**.
    ```
    Function URL (dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
    ```
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`. 
 
### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
